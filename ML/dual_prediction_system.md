# Dual Prediction System

The trading framework now supports a dual prediction system that combines traditional Machine Learning with advanced ML features for more robust and accurate trading predictions.

## Overview

The dual prediction system uses two complementary approaches:

1. **Traditional ML**: Uses order flow events, market data, and engineered features
2. **Advanced ML**: Uses microstructure analysis, regime detection, and real-time market dynamics

Both systems work together to provide more accurate predictions and better trading decisions.

## Traditional ML Features

The traditional ML system analyzes:

- **Order Flow Events**: Buy/sell orders, quantities, timing
- **Market Data**: OHLCV candles, price movements, volume
- **Engineered Features**: 
  - Volume imbalances
  - Price impact estimates
  - Order clustering patterns
  - Market microstructure indicators

## Advanced ML Features

The advanced ML system provides:

- **Imbalance Detection**: Real-time order book imbalances
- **Regime Classification**: Market state identification (accumulation, distribution, normal)
- **Liquidity Analysis**: Depth and liquidity pattern recognition
- **Microstructure Prediction**: Short-term price movement predictions
- **Shock Detection**: Sudden market movements and liquidations
- **Whale Movement Detection**: Large institutional order detection

## Configuration

Configure the dual prediction system in your strategy config:

```yaml
ml_config:
  traditional_ml_weight: 0.6
  advanced_ml_weight: 0.4
  enable_advanced_features: true
  prediction_confidence_threshold: 0.15
```

### Weight Configurations

| Configuration | Traditional | Advanced | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Traditional-heavy | 0.8 | 0.2 | Conservative trading, stable markets |
| Balanced | 0.5 | 0.5 | General purpose, mixed conditions |
| Advanced-heavy | 0.3 | 0.7 | Aggressive trading, volatile markets |
| Advanced-only | 0.0 | 1.0 | Pure advanced features |
| Traditional-only | 1.0 | 0.0 | Pure traditional features |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# The system automatically uses both prediction methods
prediction = await analyzer.predict_order_flow(
    order_events, market_data, depth_data
)

print(f"Flow Type: {prediction.predicted_flow_type}")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction.confidence}")
print(f"Expected Impact: {prediction.expected_impact}")
```

### Dynamic Weight Adjustment

```python
# Adjust weights based on market conditions
if market_volatility > 0.8:
    analyzer.set_prediction_weights(0.3, 0.7)  # Favor advanced ML
else:
    analyzer.set_prediction_weights(0.7, 0.3)  # Favor traditional ML
```

### Individual Predictions

```python
# Get predictions from each system separately
traditional_pred = await analyzer._get_traditional_prediction(
    order_events, market_data, depth_data
)

advanced_pred = await analyzer._get_advanced_prediction(
    order_events, market_data, depth_data
)

# Compare predictions
if traditional_pred.predicted_flow_type == advanced_pred.predicted_flow_type:
    print("✅ Both systems agree")
else:
    print("⚠️ Systems disagree - using ensemble")
```

## Logging and Monitoring

The system provides detailed logging:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Advanced Features Not Available**
```
Advanced features not available
```

**Prediction Disagreement**
```
⚠️ PREDICTION DISAGREEMENT:
  Traditional: normal (conf: 0.45)
  Advanced: large_buy (conf: 0.78)
```
- This is normal and expected
- System uses confidence-weighted combination
- Monitor which system performs better over time

**High Computational Load**
- Reduce advanced feature complexity
- Increase prediction intervals
- Use fewer symbols simultaneously
