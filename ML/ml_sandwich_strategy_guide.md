# Set environment variables
export SAXO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export SAXO_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
```

### 2. Configure Strategy

The strategy is already configured in `config/strategies/ml_sandwich_strategy.yaml`. You can modify the settings as needed.

### 3. Run Strategy

The ML Sandwich Strategy is configured to run from the main framework. Simply start the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The strategy will be automatically loaded and started based on the configuration in `config/main.yaml`.

### 4. Monitor Performance

The strategy provides comprehensive logging including:
- ML prediction details
- Order placement decisions
- Performance metrics
- Feature importance rankings

## Model Training

### Initial Training

The strategy can be trained with historical data:

```python
# Train with 30 days of historical data
await train_model_with_historical_data(strategy, days_back=30)
```

### Continuous Learning

The strategy automatically:
1. **Collects Training Data**: Records actual order outcomes
2. **Retrains Models**: Updates models with new data every 1000 predictions
3. **Adapts to Market Changes**: Learns from changing market conditions

### Training Data Structure

```python
training_sample = {
    'features': {
        'current_price': 2000.0,
        'volatility_5m': 0.015,
        'rsi': 65.0,
        'regime_trending_up': 1.0,
        # ... more features
    },
    'targets': {
        'buy_price': 1995.0,
        'sell_price': 2005.0,
        'spread_multiplier': 1.8,
        'order_size': 0.15,
        'profitability': 0.75
    }
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **ML Prediction Accuracy**: How well predictions match actual outcomes
- **Confidence Scores**: Reliability of ML predictions
- **Feature Importance**: Which features drive predictions
- **Regime Performance**: Strategy performance by market regime

```python
status = strategy.get_status()
print(f"ML Model Trained: {status['ml_model_trained']}")
print(f"ML Predictions Used: {status['ml_predictions_used']}")
print(f"Total Signals: {status['total_signals']}")
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Confidence Thresholds

Adjust ML usage:

```yaml
ml_confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Only use ML if confidence > 60%
fallback_to_rule_based: true  # Use rule-based when ML confidence is low
```

## Risk Management

### Built-in Safeguards

1. **Confidence Thresholds**: Only use high-confidence predictions
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Rule-based strategy when ML fails
3. **Position Limits**: Maximum position sizes
