## 💡 Key Concepts

### Order Flow Analysis
**What it is**: Analysis of how orders flow through the market
**Why it matters**: Reveals hidden institutional activity and market sentiment
**How to use**: Detect large orders, iceberg orders, and order flow imbalances

### Advanced ML Features
**What they are**: Three sophisticated modules for market microstructure analysis
**Why they're powerful**: Extract alpha from order book data, not just price data
**How they work**: Combine imbalance momentum, regime classification, and liquidity analysis

### Market Regimes
**What they are**: Different market phases (accumulation, distribution, trending, etc.)
**Why they matter**: Different strategies work better in different regimes
**How to use**: Adapt your strategy based on current regime

### Liquidity Analysis
**What it is**: Understanding market maker behavior and liquidity provision
**Why it's important**: Avoid liquidity traps and time entries better
**How to apply**: Use liquidity stress scores to adjust position sizing
